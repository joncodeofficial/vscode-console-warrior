## üß† Why Console Warrior?

Modern debugging deserves modern tools ‚Äî but until now, there wasn‚Äôt a truly **open source**, **community-driven**, and **non-profit** extension that brings real-time `console.log` output directly into VSCode.

**Console Warrior** was created to change that.

Built from the ground up and released under the **Apache 2.0 license**, this project is designed to help developers:

- ‚ö° Improve feedback loops during development
- üßº Keep their workflow clean and efficient
- ü§ù Collaborate on a tool made by and for the dev community

Whether you're contributing code or simply using it day-to-day, you're part of the mission to make debugging in VSCode a smoother experience ‚Äî without relying on closed or commercial solutions.

## ü§ù Contributing

We **welcome contributions** of all kinds! Whether you're improving documentation, optimizing performance, adding support for new environments or frameworks, or working on testing ‚Äî you're invited to collaborate.
