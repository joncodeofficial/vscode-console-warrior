3. Open a file with `console` statements
4. 🎉 Messages appear **right under your code**, with hover support for details

> 💡 Use the command palette:  
> `Console Warrior: Connect to Console Warrior Port`  
> By default it connects to **5173**, but you can use this command to set a custom port.

> ⚠️ **Currently Vite-only**  
> Console Warrior works **exclusively with Vite projects** (CSR and SSR).
