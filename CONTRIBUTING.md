# Contributing to vscode-console-warrior-logs

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! This document outlines the standards and processes we follow to maintain high code quality. Please read these guidelines before submitting pull requests.

## Code Quality Standards

- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow the existing code style and architecture
- Include appropriate documentation for new functionality
- Test your changes thoroughly

## Pull Request Process

### Before Creating a PR

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Check existing issues and PRs** to avoid duplicate work
3. **Discuss major changes** by opening an issue first

### Creating a PR

1. **Keep PRs small and focused** - Address one concern or feature per PR
2. **Thoroughly test** any new functionality
3. **Update documentation** as needed
4. **Ensure all checks pass** - All tests, linters, and CI processes should pass

### PR Description Requirements

- Clearly describe the problem you're solving or feature you're adding
- Explain your approach and reasoning. Link to any relevant resources (if applicable)
- Reference any related issues
- List any breaking changes or migration steps needed

## Review Process

Pull requests require review and approval before merging. During review:

1. Be open to feedback and suggestions
2. Respond to comments in a timely manner
3. Make requested changes or explain why they might not be appropriate
4. Be patient - reviews take time

## Code Style

In general:

- Use consistent indentation and spacing (2 spaces for tabs)
- Follow the naming conventions used throughout the project
- Group related code together
- Keep lines to a reasonable length (usually 80-100 characters)
- Use appropriate whitespace for readability

> [!TIP]
> You can run `pnpm format` to format your code during development. The code will also be formatted before committing.

## Commit Guidelines

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with the scope of the change (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, etc.)
- Use a verb in imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Mention any related issues that are being closed (`Closes #123`)
- Mention breaking changes that are introduced by this change (`BREAKING CHANGE:`)
- Keep commits focused and logical
- Consider using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format

Browse the project's [commit history](https://github.com/Wombosvideo/tw-animate-css/commits/main) for examples.

> [!TIP]
> If you're using Visual Studio Code, you can use the [Conventional Commits extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vivaxy.vscode-conventional-commits) to help you write commit messages.
